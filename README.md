- In the data folder you will find the data compressed as it is larger than 25 mb, and this is the link of data to understand the data well: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction?select=Jan_2019_ontime.csv.<br /><br /><br />
- In the deployment folder the model should be saved in (model.pkl), but it is larger than 25 mb too so, if you run the (Model.py) file it will be saved, you have to do this step before running the (App.py) file.<br /><br /><br />
- For not getting an error place the data in the same directory of notebook, and deployment files, or just modify the path of data.<br /><br /><br />
- if you like the notebook, just give it an upvote here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/karakoza22/analysis-and-prediction , and there are more notebooks will be published discussing Machine learning algorithms.  <br /><br /><br />
